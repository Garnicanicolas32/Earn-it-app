# Earn it!
#### Anti.procrastination.APP
An app that balances between tasks and rewards in your daily routine with a point system
- The app calculates with a formula the amount of points that Rewards/Task give.
- You can also customize if you want to favour rewards or task
- Can also sort with tags for more organization

# V1.0.1
